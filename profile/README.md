Vague.

And as much as I want to exist, it becomes apparent to me that, well, I have nothing to put on the table to begin with.

I am egotistical and, at the same time, fragile.

I want to strive for greatness but am afraid of the uncertainty of my future.

So, I created this collection of my works.

So, I have value. I have a voice.

Exist 4 as long as 1 can.

## What to do now?

Apart from the edgy stuff above, this really is just my collection of work.

More like "documentations" of what I think and develop along the way.

So, I will try to explain stuff, reference stuff, and deprive myself of a healthy sleeping pattern.

I guess I should learn to drink coffee. [But it tends to go poorly for me.](https://coffeeaffection.com/why-does-coffee-make-you-pee/)

And learn to live better, [if there is even a notion of "better" in it.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_nihilism)

Absurd, isn't it?
